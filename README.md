 ## Employee Records Dataset Cleaning
# Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a raw employee records dataset for reliable analysis and reporting. The original dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues that could compromise data integrity. The goal was to apply systematic data cleaning techniques to produce a high-quality, analysis-ready dataset.

# Dataset Description
Original File: clean_data_Employee_Records_dataset.xlsx
Initial Records: 2000
Final Records After Cleaning: 1893
Format: Excel (.xlsx)
 #Cleaning Process Summary
 1. Duplicate Removal
Checked for and removed any duplicate entries to ensure each employee record is unique.
Duplicates found: 0
 2. Handling Missing Values
Email: Ensured no records had missing email addresses.
Department: Filled 92 missing department values with "Unknown" to maintain completeness without discarding data.
 3. Email Validation
Used regular expressions to validate email formats.
Removed 107 records with invalid or malformed email addresses.
 4. Standardization
Standardized department names to title case (e.g., "hr" â†’ "Hr") to ensure consistency across records.
 5. Data Integrity Checks
Verified that all remaining records had valid and complete key fields (e.g., Employee ID, Name, Email).
Ensured consistent formatting across categorical fields.
